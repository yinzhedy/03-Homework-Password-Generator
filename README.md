## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a functional password generator. I included a criteria section prior to password generation, for the user to signify if they wanted to include the following: numbers, symbols/special characters, and uppercase letters. The default is to include lowercase letters. I decided that, in place of browser prompts, a form would provide the user with a cleaner, more efficient, and overall pleasant experience. I wanted to create a user interface that was pleasant, simple, and straightforward, while still ensuring all necessary criteria was present for accurate password generation. I ensured that the minimum character length for the password was 8 characters and the maximum length would be 128 characters. The generated password is then displayed to the user immediately via the password display box. Currently working on adding addition aesthetic features, in addition to the color scheme found on the page; these "coming soon" features for the deployed application include a welcome screen, with a short timer, upon loading the page, as well as an animation for the generate password button to display each time it is clicked/submitted by the user.
